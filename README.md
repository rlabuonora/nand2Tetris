# Nand2Tetris

Code for [Nand2Tetris] (http://www.nand2tetris.org/)


# Hardware
All the Hardware is implemented in HDL. The CPU chip is still missing...
# Software
* The Assembler and the VMTranslator are implemented in Javascript and pass supplied tests.
* The VMTranslator is in projects/07, but passes the tests for project 08.

A review about the course is forthcoming on [my blog] (https://rlabuonora74.wordpress.com/2016/03/30/nand2tetris/)
